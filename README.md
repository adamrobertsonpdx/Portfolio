Hello and Welcome to my Portfolio!

  My name is Adam Robertson, I am an Electromechanical Engineering major with a minor in Applied Mathematics studying at Wentworth Institute of Technology. My specialty is in AI integration into controls systems.

  There are 3 projects within this repository. 
  The main.c file is the main file for Pico-sat. The program is set to take data from a camera using DCMI and transmit that data into a JPEG using UART. 
  The finalcode.py is from a mini-golf robot. The program uses the PIGAME library to take inputs from a Steam Deck, then uses the serial wire to transmit that data to an Arduino, which acts as the controller for the motors and servos. 
  The Ball Sorting project is for a ball bearing sorting machine. Click into that project for more info.
