  There are 3 projects within this repository. 
  The main.c file is main file for Pico-sat, the program is set to take data from a camera using DCMI, then transmit that data into a jpeg using uart. 
  The master.py is from a mini-golf robot. The program uses PIGAME library to take inputs from a steamdeck, then use the serial wire to transmit that data to an arduino which acts as the controller for the motors and servos. 
  The Ball Sorting project is for a ball bearing sorting machine click into that project for more info.
